# Automatic Sprinkler
The project is intended to let your plant to survive while you are on holiday and you do not have any intention to buy built-in mechanism that prevent you to expand and adjust the system to your needs.

If you find this project it means that you are going to build it :)

# Getting started

## Folder Structure

The Repository is structure so that:

|Folder|Content description|
|-|-|
|/3d_files|It contans all the stl files that you need to print for the project.|
|/Board|It contains the reference schematics of the PCB|
|/Board/Production/|It contains the different files for fabrication or editing|
|/SourceCode|It contains all the developend source code|
|/SourceCode/src/ + sprinkler.py|It is the code needed for the Raspberry Pi Pico W to control the PCB board. The *src* folder has to be uploaded on the microcontroller while the *sprinkerl.py* can be executed locally for tests or uploaded on the target as well.|
|/SourceCode/Scripts/|It contains some tests that can be executed to test the wiring.|
|/SourceCode/optional_source|It contains the code that can be used to create a controller with another Raspberry Pico W. It is intended to force the pump activation. The folder Raspberry_Pi_2 contains the code to set up a small server to monitor the data with Grafana.|
|/SourceCode/doc|It contains some additional references.|

## Software

The file must be named ***main.py*** in order to be executed directly at the start-up of the shield.

## How to start to test the softwarre

* Copy the */src* folder that you find the SourceCode folder to your Raspberry Pico W

* Copy / execute the file *sprinkler.py* . If you want that it will be executed automatically at the startup you have to copy the file *sprinkler.py* to Raspberry Pico and rename it as *main.py*

# Licence

Please check the dedicated file in *main* branch.
